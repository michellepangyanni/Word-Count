COMP 321 Project 2: Word Count
<Michelle Pang, yp29>

---(Do not write lines of text that exceed the width of this line.)------------

TESTING STRATEGY

Black Box Testig Strategy: <

1. Input file only contains an empty line, should return 1 word, 0 line, 
and 1 character.

2. Input file only contains many, n for example, empty lines, should 
return n line, 0 word, and n character. 

3. Input file contains many odd characters such as % & ( @ ! *)

4. Input file contains new lines in weird places. 
eg. New lines in between large chunks of texts, new line at the beginning 
or the end of the file, or many new lines in between texts.              //should i say new line or empty line here??

5. Input files with names that are of different ASCIIbetical orders.
eg. file_name = 0.txt, file_name = xyz, file_name = XYZ， file_name = abc

6. Input file contains odd words such as @#$^%&^*&)()_  and hyphenated words.

7. Input file has text and multiple empty lines.

8. Input file only contains double spaces.

9. Input files are all error files

10. The first input file is an invalid file

11. Input files that does not exist. 

12. Input files are a mix of valid files and invalid files.

13. Input file only has one word.

14. Input file only has one character.

15. Input files are multiple files of the same file.

White Box Testing Strategy(categorized by function) <

1. The input file is empty, to test line295-303. 
2. The input file has only one character/word
3. The input files has file names that are not in ASCIIbetical order
4. ... to ensure that the program print error and stops 
5. To test line 269: a input file that has many random spaces between texts, to ensure A word is detected for 
			1. it is not a space. 
			2. the previous character is a space
6. Input file is a new line. To test line 276: Update line count when the current character is the new line character
7. Test that the program catches the error when the file cannot be read and stops
8. 




weird cases
how to count c, l, w. 
Try to find edge case that might mess up.
A file does not have a new line at the end.
counting the last word.
Invalid name that does not exist.
New line is a character.
